# DetourEats App v0.3

This is the cleaned-up public prototype for DetourEats.com.

## What changed from v0.1

- Switched the brand direction from orange to green.
- Replaced the placeholder DE icon with a green road/fork food icon.
- Simplified the public setup screen around the core action: **Trust Us**.
- Hid simulation/debug controls behind a **Show Demo Controls** toggle.
- Kept the Detour Score prominent on the recommendation card.
- Updated app metadata, theme color, and PWA manifest.

## What it does

- Trip setup screen
- Trust Us / drive mode
- Detour Score recommendation card
- Recommendation tiers:
  - Worth the Detour
  - Best Breakfast Ahead
  - Best Stop Ahead
  - Best Available
  - Keep Driving
- Estimated arrival time by candidate
- Auto meal/daypart logic
- Open-at-arrival logic
- Skip recommendation
- Google Maps handoff
- Browser notification test
- PWA manifest and service worker

## Important limitations

This is still a prototype.

Current placeholder assumptions:
- Route position is simulated with a hidden demo slider.
- Candidate ETA assumes about 45 minutes between candidate sequence stops.
- Candidate data is seeded from test-route research.
- Restaurant hours are sample prototype hours, not verified live hours.
- Google Maps handoff opens a restaurant search, not a fully managed route waypoint flow.

Production needs:
- Real routing API
- GPS/current location
- Route polyline
- Route corridor candidate discovery
- Real ETA to each restaurant
- Real added-trip-time calculation
- Live/official hours and special hours
- Stored restaurant intelligence database
- User accounts / saved preferences
- Backend refresh jobs

## How to open locally

Unzip the folder and open `index.html` in Chrome.

## How to deploy to DetourEats.com

Upload the contents of this folder to the GitHub repo connected to Vercel, then redeploy.

If the service worker caches the old version, hard refresh the browser or unregister the service worker from DevTools.


## v0.2.3 note
The illustrated icon was replaced with a clean temporary DE mark so the live site looks stable while the final logo is still being developed.


## v0.3 focus

This version improves the product behavior without changing the live logo direction.

New / improved:
- Clearer trip states:
  - Keep Driving
  - Found Something
  - This Is Your Stop
  - Bucket List Stop
  - Best Available
- Stronger recommendation language.
- Better "why this stop" copy.
- Better fallback behavior if the recommendation engine changes.
- Cleaner handling of skipped recommendations.
- Keeps debug controls hidden from normal user flow.

Still simulated:
- Route data
- Restaurant data
- ETA / added trip time
- Live hours
